# Flutter Firebase Integration Practice

A Flutter project to practice integrating Firebase services like Authentication and Firestore.

## Quick Start

1. Install Flutter: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
2. Run from the project root:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Firebase Setup

Add your platform-specific Firebase config files locally (do not commit):
- Android: `android/app/google-services.json`
- iOS/macOS: `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` or `macos/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`

Download these from the Firebase Console and place them in the paths above.

## Important

Do not commit API keys or Firebase config files. They are ignored by `.gitignore`.
